About
-------------

The RISC-V ISA Simulator implements a functional model of one or more
RISC-V processors.

Build Steps
---------------

We assume that the RISCV environment variable is set to the RISC-V tools
install path, and that the riscv-fesvr package is installed there.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure --prefix=$RISCV --with-fesvr=$RISCV
    $ make
    $ [sudo] make install

Compiling and Running a Simple C Program
-------------------------------------------

Install spike (see Build Steps), riscv-gnu-toolchain, and riscv-pk.

Write a short C program and name it hello.c.  Then, compile it into a RISC-V
ELF binary named hello:

    $ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello hello.c

Now you can simulate the program atop the proxy kernel:

    $ spike pk hello

Simulating a New Instruction
------------------------------------

Adding an instruction to the simulator requires two steps:

  1.  Describe the instruction's functional behavior in the file
      riscv/insns/<new_instruction_name>.h.  Examine other instructions
      in that directory as a starting point.

  2.  Add the opcode and opcode mask to riscv/opcodes.h.  Alternatively,
      add it to the riscv-opcodes package, and it will do so for you:

         $ cd ../riscv-opcodes
         $ vi opcodes       // add a line for the new instruction
         $ make install

  3.  Rebuild the simulator.

Interactive Debug Mode
---------------------------

To invoke interactive debug mode, launch spike with -d:

    $ spike -d pk hello

To see the contents of an integer register (0 is for core 0):

    : reg 0 a0

To see the contents of a floating point register:

    : fregs 0 ft0

or:

    : fregd 0 ft0

depending upon whether you wish to print the register as single- or double-precision.

To see the contents of a memory location (physical address in hex):

    : mem 2020

To see the contents of memory with a virtual address (0 for core 0):

    : mem 0 2020

You can advance by one instruction by pressing <enter>. You can also
execute until a desired equality is reached:

    : until pc 0 2020                   (stop when pc=2020)
    : until mem 2020 50a9907311096993   (stop when mem[2020]=50a9907311096993)

Alternatively, you can execute as long as an equality is true:

    : while mem 2020 50a9907311096993

You can continue execution indefinitely by:

    : r

At any point during execution (even without -d), you can enter the
interactive debug mode with `<control>-<c>`.

To end the simulation from the debug prompt, press `<control>-<c>` or:

    : q

Debugging With Gdb
------------------

An alternative to interactive debug mode is to attach using gdb. When invoked
with '--gdb-port <port>' spike will listen on the given TCP port.  It's
possible to attach with gdb (that has riscv support compiled in) by entering
`target remote localhost:<port>` in gdb. For example, in one shell run:
```
spike --gdb-port 9824 pk tests/debug
```

Then in a second shell you may do something like:
```
